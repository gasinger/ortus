#Dummy page for upcoming Dynamic Main Menu

= Custom Filters =

How to add a Custom filter:

1. Create a Static Context for your menu item and name it "Custom", leave the Value blank by pressing the accept button.
2. Now you'll need to edit the menu.xml located at SageTV\SageTV\STVs\Ortus\0 with the filter you require. An example filter would look like:

filter: mediatype = 2 and mediagroup = 1; sort: mediaimporttime desc;limit:100

Where:

mediatype = 2 is for Movies
mediagroup = 1 is for imported media
sort: is how you would like the sorting to occur with desc (desc or asc)
limit is the amount of media files you want to appear in the overall list
